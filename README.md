# SQL Project Portfolio
This repository contains a portfolio of SQL projects that were completed by me for academic and self learning purposes. 

The datasets and databases used in these projects are for demostration purposes.

## Folder Content
- Database
- Scripts containing SQL commands to query and manage the data
- Jupyter Notebooks containing SQL Queries that extract data for further analysis
